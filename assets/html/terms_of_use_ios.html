<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>The MGH Heart App (“The Heart App”) is a reference application developed by Massachusetts General Hospital (“MGH”) that serves as a digital repository for aortic dissection screening and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (”ECMO”). The protocols and information have been developed by clinicians at Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>

<p>The Heart App is intended for use solely by licensed physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners and emergency medical technicians as an informational resource only and solely within such individual’s scope of expertise and practice. THE HEART APP IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL’S INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL JUDGMENT, ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS, OR TREATMENT. The Heart App is not to be used by non-medical professionals.</p>
